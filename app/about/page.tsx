          In 2016 Made In Workshop opened its doors with only a small laser cutter, 3D printers 
          and miscellaneous hand tools and machines. As members came and went, 
          Made In Workshop moulded a space that was not only an essential asset 
          to our customers/members it was also their community.
          <br />
          <br />
          Made In Workshop is <span className="text-primary">not just about the tools</span> and <span className="text-primary">machines </span>and not just about
           the <span className="text-primary">workspace</span>, weâ€™re the spark of inspiration that is the culmination 
           of tools, machines, workspace and the community that we are creating.
