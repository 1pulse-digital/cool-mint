Our machine purchases are carefully selected by thoroughly analysing the needs and behaviours of our members as they work in our workshops. Over the last 4 years, we have established solid relationships with tool suppliers, manufacturers and agents from around the world, which allows us to procure high-quality machinery that is reliable and effective.
<br/><br/>
We see these machines putting our members a step ahead in their industries. To complement the metalworking facilities at Made in Workshop, we have acquired two brand new ICON 370 Amp three-phase, Mig welders and one new 370 Amp three phase Tig welder. These units are water-cooled with digital controllers which allow for longer welding cycles with quicker turnarounds between parts. The digital controllers add an extra level of control to the welding process. This allows novices and newbies to quickly learn how to weld or to improve their skills while also providing professional welders with faster and cleaner welds. In the case of an unplanned breakdown, our local supplier, Instruweld, will assist with any services needed to get our members welding again in no time!
