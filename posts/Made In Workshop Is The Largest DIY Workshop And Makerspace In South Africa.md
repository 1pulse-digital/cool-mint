Made In Workshop is the largest DIY workshop and makerspace in South Africa.
<br/><br/>
We provide the highest calibre tools, machines, and workspaces for our customers to use. We have instructors who ensure each member understands how to use our services safely and effectively.
<br/><br/>
Whether you are completing a home project or starting a new high-tech business, our friendly staff and large community of makers are always here to support and help.
<br/><br/>
Since we opened our doors in 2017, we have always challenged conventions and the ways that things around us are made. We’re fervent supporters of the Maker Movement and are connected to other maker spaces around the world for support, inspiration, and the sharing of ideas.
<br/><br/>
We are not only home to a wide array of tools, machinery and workspaces but we have a vibrant and growing community of makers, engineers, designers and inventors, Made In Workshop provides the perfect platform for prototyping, manufacturing and development in South Africa.
<br/><br/>
“For the first time in human history, we live in a time where for a very affordable price someone could think of an idea, design that idea, iterate that idea, manufacture that idea, and sell that idea in a matter of weeks or months and not in years. And not for millions of rands but for the price that an average small business could afford.”
<br/><br/>
Every day my staff and I meet individuals or SMEs who are looking to either start a new business or complement their existing workshop with a machine that they do not have access to.
<br/><br/>
Please call us. Tour our facility. Take a class or become a member. See how easy it is to design and build your ideas and dreams. It does not matter how much noise you make. There is someone who makes more.
