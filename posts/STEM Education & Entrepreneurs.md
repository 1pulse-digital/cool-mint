<p>The maker community surrounding Made In Workshop is consistently learning new skills, and he has discovered a vital link between hands-on learning and business growth.<br/><br/>

<p>“I've immersed myself in extensive research on STEM education in schools, uncovering its profound importance. Through my inquiries into the merits of STEM education, I've come to understand its critical role in fostering:<br/><br/>

<ul>
<li>Economic Growth and Innovation</li>
<li>Critical Thinking and Problem-Solving</li>
<li>Digital Literacy</li>
<li>Global Competitiveness</li>
<li> Addressing Societal Challenges</li>
<li>Promoting Innovation</li>
<li> Equity and Inclusion</li>
<li>Lifelong Learning</li>
</ul>
<br/><br/>
However, I've observed a significant gap in STEM education that affects both past and future learners, illustrated through my own educational journey.<br/><br/>

<p>Reflecting on my schooling, I remember engaging in Industrial Arts, now termed EGD. It encompassed metalwork, woodworking, mechanics, and drawing—symbolized by the iconic drawing board encased in a black cloth sleeve. The decline of such hands-on subjects, with workshops disappearing from schools, is a loss. The reasons behind this shift are complex and multifaceted.<br/><br/>

Moving to the present, my educational background lacked programming—a skill not taught in our computer labs, which were focused on typing and speed reading, without access to modern tools like LEGO Mind storms or other STEM kits. Yet, in my current role, these are the very skills I find indispensable. Adult education in STEM now often 
relies on platforms like YouTube and courses and workshops, signifying a shift in how we acquire and update our knowledge base.<br/><br/>

There's a disconnect between the theoretical prowess in programming a robot to follow a line, as taught in contemporary STEM education, and the practical application of skills in real-world scenarios. This gap becomes apparent even among university-educated individuals when faced with practical challenges.<br/><br/>

STEM education at the school level is missing foundational elements—practical, hands-on skills that were imparted to previous generations. To truly realize the potential of STEM and fulfil the promises outlined at the beginning of this discourse, a return to grassroots engineering and practical application is necessary. Moreover, addressing the educational needs of adults in the workforce is equally crucial.<br/><br/>

By teaching foundational engineering concepts to students and providing STEM learning opportunities to adults, we can cultivate a workforce that is versatile, skilled, and balanced across age groups. This approach not only bridges the gap between theory and practice but also ensures that the benefits of STEM education are fully realized, making the optimistic visions for STEM's impact on economic growth, innovation, and societal challenges a tangible reality."<br/><br/>

Made In Workshop is more than a place for local businesses to produce their products; it’s a hub for a community of people learning new skills & building their careers.</p>
