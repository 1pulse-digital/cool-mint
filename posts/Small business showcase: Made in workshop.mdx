In 2016 Made In Workshop opened its doors with only a small laser cutter, 3D printers and miscellaneous hand tools and machines. As members came and went, Made In Workshop moulded a space that was not only an essential asset for its customers/members it was also their community. “Not just about the tools and machines. Not just about the workspace. The spark of inspiration that is the culmination of tools, machines, workspace and the community that we are creating.”
