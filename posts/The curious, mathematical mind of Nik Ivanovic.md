“I had a Lego-obsessed childhood,” says Nik Ivanovic. “And I’ve always wanted to understand the mathematics behind the mechanisms.”

Nik has a degree in mechanical engineering from the University of the Witwatersrand and he is currently doing his master’s part-time. As part of his master’s, he had to find a way to make 3D-metal printed products last longer.
<br/><br/>
One of the technologies that <span className="text-primary"> <a href ="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=da5IsmZZ-tw" target="_blank">3D metal printing</a></span> uses is <span className="text-primary"> <a href ="https://all3dp.com/2/direct-metal-laser-sintering-dmls-simply-explained/" target="_blank">Direct Metal Laser Sintering (DMLS) </a></span>which models, slices, and then prints an object layer by layer. The DMLS printer is filled with metal powder that’s dispensed as a thin layer onto the build platform. A laser then follows a predefined path (based on coding sent to the printer), and sinters/fuses the powder into a solid. Another layer of powder is dispensed, and the process continues, layer by layer.
<br/><br/>
“It is a specialised and very expensive process and the demand needs to be there for it to be viable,” Nik stresses.
<br/><br/>
Nik’s master’s project could only be completed at <span className="text-primary"> <a href ="https://crpm.co.za/" target="_blank">the Centre for Rapid Prototyping and Manufacturing</a></span> (CRPM) in the Free State, because, at the time, it was the only university to have metal 3D printing machines – in fact, the CRPM was the first centre in Africa to get certification for 3D printing of medical devices.
<br/><br/>
Nik’s research didn’t involve machining things like titanium jawbones, but rather focused on the engineering side of things.
<br/><br/>
“3D metal printing is increasingly being used to produce highly complicated aerospace components in low volume, which is what I find really interesting,” adds Nik.

At CRPM Nik printed his components in titanium on an industry-standard sized machine – he points out that the world’s biggest 3D metal printer, which is being used for aerospace development, is located in Pretoria. The machine is part of <span className="text-primary"> <a href ="https://www.businessinsider.com/" target="_blank">Project Areoswift</a></span>, and the printer takes up to R7,5 million in titanium powder to fill it.
<br/><br/>
Nik has been a recurring member of Made In Workshop, and one of his projects was building a CNC plotter from scratch.
<br/><br/>
“It’s a device where you clamp a pen in its holder, and it converts a vector or PSD file into code that becomes a drawing using the X and Y axes,” explains Nik.  
<br/><br/>
“Made In Workshop has all the tools that I will ever need; it’s a very capable little nook,” he adds.
