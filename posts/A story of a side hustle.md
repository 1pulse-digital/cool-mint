Creating and selling unique products is a straightforward and viable method to generate additional income. This practice has been a part of human culture since ancient times. Selecting an appropriate product for the right market can lead to substantial profit margins. Moreover, if you manage to perfectly align the market demand, marketing, and efficient manufacturing, this side venture has the potential to evolve into a primary source of income.<br/><br/>

Instead of drafting a typical, lengthy article filled with unverified information, let’s dive deeper with a practical example. Taking inspiration from one of our members currently manufacturing metalwork products, specifically furniture. Due to the over saturated market and shrinking profit margins of the furniture industry, shifting focus to a product in demand, such as professional welding tables for manufacturing, was a logical choice. The shift in production aimed at crafting robust steel welding benches seemed to promise significantly higher profit margins.<br/><br/>

Relying on the data to validates the change, we have put together the basic costing breakdown for the production of 3 tables:<br/><br/>

Consistent effort and dedication to solving this dilemma is where a true side hustle is born, from conception through CAD design, to eventually reaching a profitable product offering. What is essential to the execution of any side hustle is creating a starting point that does not take you backwards, by making sure deposits cover material costs, and any additional consumables and memberships are settled beforehand. Lowering your risk and giving your business the profit boost needed when balances are paid.<br/><br/>

Our membership benefits made it possible for this member to plan deliveries, store materials and work as and when needed in order to execute their project on time. A workshop assistant was also brought in to give a hand moving the heavy steel pieces, streamlining production and making it possible to complete the project in a single day.<br/><br/>

The entirety of the revenue generated was profit, this was possible as a Made In Workshop membership eliminated the costs needed to invest in the various tools and machinery for the job. Highlighting how an individual can easily leverage membership costs for higher profit margins.<br/><br/>

In conclusion, for a single day of production, our member earned enough to create financial breathing room, the profit generated can go towards kid’s school fees, car payments, groceries or invest.
