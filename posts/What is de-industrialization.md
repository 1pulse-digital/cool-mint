For those of you who do not know what a dead tree is, well it is another name for a book. In my case, a research paper that I had printed out. It was a report on manufacturing, and it made reference to a term “Productive Capability.”<br/><br/>

Productive capabilities refer to the resources, skills, technologies, and knowledge that a firm, a country, or a region has at its disposal to produce goods and services. They are the underlying factors that enable an entity to produce and innovate. Productive capabilities are often seen as a key determinant of a country's or region's competitiveness and ability to generate economic growth.<br/><br/>

It is important to note that productive capabilities are not fixed, but are dynamic and can be developed and enhanced over time through investment and innovation. The concept of productive capabilities is closely related to the idea of economic development and the idea of catching-up development. Where a country or a region can enhance its productive capabilities through learning from more advanced economies and by investing in the necessary factors to catch up with them.<br/><br/>

A maker space, like Made In Workshop, can play a role in improving productive capabilities by providing access to resources, knowledge, and expertise that can help 
individuals and small businesses to design, prototype, and manufacture new products. Some ways Made In workshop helps individuals and Companies<br/><br/>

1. *** Access to tools and equipment:**<br/>
Maker spaces provide access to a wide range of tools and equipment, such as 3D printers, CNC machines, and laser cutters, that can be used to design and prototype new products. This can improve physical capital by allowing individuals and small businesses to access the equipment andtechnologies they need to produce goods and services.<br/><br/>
2. **Access to knowledge and expertise:** <br/>Maker spaces bring together a community of individuals with diverse skills and knowledge, providing an opportunity for individuals to learn from others and to share their own knowledge and expertise. This can improve human capital by increasing the skills and knowledge of the workforce.<br/><br/>
3. **Low-cost prototyping:** <br/>Maker spaces can provide individuals and small businesses with a low-cost way to prototype new products, which can help to reduce the risk and cost of product development. This can improve organizational capital by allowing businesses to experiment and learn from new product development.<br/><br/>
4. **Networking and collaboration:** <br/>Maker spaces can provide individuals and small businesses with an opportunity to network and collaborate with others in the community, which can help to build new partnerships and collaborations. This can improve social capital by creating new networks of suppliers and customers.<br/><br/>
5. **Innovation and experimentation:**<br/>
Maker spaces can foster an environment of innovation and experimentation, where individuals and small businesses can take risks and try new ideas, which can lead to the development of new products and technologies. This can improve organizational capital by allowing businesses to experiment and learn from new product development. It is important to note that while a maker space can be beneficial in improving productive capabilities, it can only play a supporting role. Other factors, such as education, infrastructure, governance and institutions, and access to finance and markets, are also necessary to create an enabling environment for economic growth and development.<br/><br/>

One factor that was not mentioned in this research paper was that the individual must **WANT** to improve and develop themselves. All too often, it seems to be easier
to have an idea and get someone else to develop and design the idea into a product. There must be a willingness to learn something new and difficult, and the willingness to get your hands dirty and even fail. We could talk until we are blue in the face of how institutions and governments need to do something first, but I think we need to start 
this process ourselves and own it.
